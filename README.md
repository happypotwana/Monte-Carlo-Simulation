The code is about the Extraction of the half-life and the radioactive decay of a radionuclide.
The code follows statistical processes like the Poisson and Uniform distribution to create statistical probabilities of undecayed nuclei.
The code also uses the inverse integral of the decay law to generate random time intervals to be used in the Poisson distribution.
The obtained decay times are then sorted and used for the simulation.
